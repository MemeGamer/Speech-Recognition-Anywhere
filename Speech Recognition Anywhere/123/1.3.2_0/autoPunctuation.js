Why
Just why "should" I stay? Tell me why you want to leave.
There are many reasons why I should go. This is why I want to leave.
Why "does" she do that? Why she does that I'll never know.

Where
Where are you going? I'm going where no one can follow me.
Go where I tell you. Where it lands nobody knows.
Where I am going you can't follow. Where you see a dog, just wait.
Where are the clouds? Where he goes nobody knows.

When
When you see a fence stay there. When "do" you want to leave? When "will" I see you again?
I'd like to know when you are going. When they arrive keep them company.
When I leave here I'm going to the store. 
When I leave here "should" I take a shower? When you see the mailman "would" you stop him for me?
When there are no cars you can cross. When there are no cars "may" I cross?
When that happens don't freak out. When Bob comes let him in. When cats hunt they are alone. When cats hunt "are" they alone?
When "does" she arrive? When she "does" that I go crazy. When Bob comes "can" you let him in.


What
What I have to say is hard to beleive. What they do is their business.
What she does there is silly. What I like about you is your hair.
That is what it takes to be a plumber. What you see is what you get.
When she arrives "what" will she be wearing? That is what will happen.
She told me what to do. That is what should happen. What "should" I do?
When I leave here "what" "should" Bob do? When I left here "what" I saw was amazing!
What "else" "can" you do? What on earth? What "the" hell? What "the" cat does is stupid.
What "a" coward. What "a" goat sees it eats.

If
If she leaves try to stop her. If I go "will" "you" come with me? If I leave "can" "you" get her?
If she leaves "should" "I" try to stop her? If she leaves "you" "should" try to stop her.
If she leaves "don't" stop her. If the toilet overflows "what" "should" "I" do?

Which
Which way should I go? Which one do you want? Which dog?
Which "is" exactly what I said. Which "can" be tricky. Which "was" the right thing to do.?
Which "can" work sometimes. Which "could" never work. Which "will" never work.

Does
Does she like cats? Doesn't everyone?

Did
Before I left last night did the cat wake you up?
Did it work? When you used the cup did it work?
He did it. He did it again. Did he leave? He did. 

Do
Do what you want. Do not go in there.
Do you like me? Do I know you? Do they live here? Do cats like water? Do techs like to eat?
Do white people live here? (people = plural) Do white persons live here?

Don't
Don't do that! Don't have a fit! 
Don't you like cats? Don't you know? Don't you like it? Don't they want to go?

How
How I would love to start over. How she looks right now is amazing.
How on earth did that happen? How much? How fat are you? How about that?
How come there are no plants? How are you? How is it going?

Should
Should she come? Should I leave? (It) Should work. 
Should it work then I'll go. Should they stay? 
Should they stay then I'll leave.

May
May I leave now? May she come with me?

Might
Might you like to go?

Who
Who else would it be? Who does she like? Who can it be now? Who are you? Who does she like? Who am I?
Who she likes is very special. Who a person is will come to light.

Could 
(It) Could be. Could it be a cat? Could John come over. Could he?
Could that happen? (It) Could rain. 

Have
Have one. Have a nice day. Have all the candy you want.
Have it your way. 
Have there been any changes? (Should be Has)
Have the Baker's gone there? Have they all left?
Have you gone there? Have I seen it? Haven't you?

Has
Has anyone seen it? Has everyone gone there? Has it been that long?
Has anything changed? Hasn't everybody?

Won't
(It) Won't work. (It) Won't happen. 
Won't you come? Won't it be hard?  Won't there be any dip?
